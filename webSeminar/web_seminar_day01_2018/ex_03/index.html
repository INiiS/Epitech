		I'm Sebastien Sattler, PGT3 student at Epitech, I'm 26 years old, NOT single. As many of my friends, I'm very into videogames, movies, series, as well as what's called "otaku culture", that means japanese animation and mangas. I also like to inform myself about general Japanese culture, and history. I think of myself as somewhat curious, some may say I'm quite shy at the beginning. But don't worry, it gets better with time.
